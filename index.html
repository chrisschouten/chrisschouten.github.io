	<h2>My life in a nut shell</h2>
	<p>I have two boys names Luke and Logan who are 4 and 7 respectivly.  They are loads of fun and keep me very busy!  We currently live in Downers Grove.  I am a Financial Advisor but really want to transition into a junior Full Stack developer.</p>

	<h2>Why I joined Dev Bootcamp</h2>
	<p>I feel the banking and finance industries are the next to be commoditzed by technology and that bankers are the 2016 version of 1990 travel agents.  I enjoy solving business problems and technology has always been an interest of mine.</p>
